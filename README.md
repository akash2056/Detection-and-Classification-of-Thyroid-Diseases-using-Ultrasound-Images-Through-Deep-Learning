# Detection-and-Classification-of-Thyroid-Diseases-using-Ultrasound-Images-Through-Deep-Learning
The thyroid gland in the human body is responsible for producing and regulating the metabolism of the body and hence is a 
very important gland in our body and thus requires high care and nurturing. The types of disorders that can occur because of
the low or high secretion of the hormones by the thyroid gland which leads to various abnormalities and differences in shape and size.
Another reason for the project was scale as there are around 42 million people in India suffering from different kinds of abnormalities. 
The existing system which is put in place to detect and rectify diseases related to the thyroid gland is either absolute or uses the image-based 
analysis of the gland. The image-based analysis of the thyroid gland and tissue is faulty in the way that it produces low-resolution images and thus 
the subjective knowledge of the doctor is limited in analyzing the thyroid ultrasound. So in this project, we have proposed a robust approach to solving
the above-stated problem through the use of Deep Learning. The model proposed by us comprises the image acquisition, Pre-processing the images(converting images 
to an array) followed by segmentation of the images using K-means clustering and using the convolutional neural networks to train and test and model which would 
help in classification as well as the localization of the diseased part in the ultrasound image of the thyroid gland. The project was tested on a dataset of the
ultrasound images which are obtained from Nepalgunj Medical College &amp; Teaching Hospital and Lumbini Medical College &amp; Teaching Hospital. The dataset was 
used to further test the model and for future work related to thyroid diseases classification using ultrasound.
