# Detection-and-Classification-of-Thyroid-Diseases-using-Ultrasound-Images-Through-Deep-Learning
The thyroid gland in the human body is responsible for producing and regulating 
the metabolism of the body and hence is a very important gland in our body and thus requires high care and nurturing. The types of disorders that can occur because of
the low or high secretion of the hormones by the thyroid gland which leads to various abnormalities and differences in shape and size. Another reason for the project was scale as there are around 42 million people in India suffering from different kinds of abnormalities. In this project, we have proposed a robust approach to solving the above stated problem through the use of Deep Learning. The model proposed by us comprises the image acquisition, Pre-processing the images(converting images to an array) followed by segmentation of the images using K-means clustering and using the convolutional neural networks to train and test and model which would help in classification as well as the localization of the diseased part in the ultrasound image of the thyroid gland. The project was tested on a dataset of the ultrasound images which are obtained from Nepalgunj Medical College &amp; Teaching Hospital and Lumbini Medical College &amp; Teaching Hospital. The dataset was used to further test the model and for future work related to thyroid diseases classification using ultrasound.
